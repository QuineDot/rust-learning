[Rust programming language.](https://www.rust-lang.org/)  The advice in

familiarity of Rust -- for example, those who have worked through
[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) -- but are still experiencing
the growing pains of learning Rust.

## [Practical suggestions for building intuition around borrow errors](lifetime-intuition.md)

In this section we outline the basics of understanding lifetimes and borrowing for
those who are struggling with understanding borrow check errors.

## [Miscellanea](./miscellanea.md)

This section collects relatively small and self-contained tutorials and other tidbits.

## [A tour of `dyn Trait`](./dyn-trait.md)

In this section we explore what `dyn Trait` is and is not, go over its limitations
and strengths, deep dive on how lifetimes work with `dyn Trait`, provide some
common `dyn Trait` recipes, and more.

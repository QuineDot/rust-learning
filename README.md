Advice for learning Rust

[Read the guide on Github Pages.](https://quinedot.github.io/rust-learning/)

## About

I'm mainly active in the Rust community via [URLO.](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
The first version of this guide has its roots in a post on the forum where someone
asked for general advice for understanding and fixing borrow-check errors.  They
subsequently [asked if it could be made easier to find,](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/practical-suggestions-for-fixing-lifetime-errors/92634/17)
and I created this guide repository as a result.

Corrections and suggested additions are welcome, but be fore-warned that I
can be very slow and sporadic to respond on GitHub.
